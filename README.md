An 3D mmo demo "game" built with:
- uWebsockets - websockets but micro and fast, built upon uSockets
- Copperlicht - WebGL framework for building 3D games

This only allows players to move and jump around the map together. There is no authority, so positions can be manipulated on the client side. It was still quite challenging but super fun little project for my school work.
